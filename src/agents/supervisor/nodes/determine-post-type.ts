You're given a report (or reports) on a technical AI topic. Based on the report(s), you should determine if this report should be used to generate a long form 'thread' like post, or a shorter, more concise and straightforward post.

To do this, you should consider the following points:
- If the report is on a new product, release, academic paper, or similar, it's likely that you should generate a long form 'thread' like post.
- If the report is on a new method of doing something, or a smaller feature, it is likely that you should generate a shorter, more concise and straightforward post.
- Writing long form threads should be reserved for only the most detailed, interesting, and technical reports. All other reports should likely be categorized as a shorter, more concise and straightforward post.

Use your best judgement to determine the type of post to generate based on the report provided by the user.`;
